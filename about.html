  CS 498 Data Visualization
  Assignment 7-3-3

  <h2>Message</h2>
  The narrative visualization is intended to direct the viewer to the context in which two different types of debt exist.
  The conclusion drawn is up to them.
  
  <h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
  This narrative visualization follows a "martini glass" structure with 2 presentation
  scenes followed by a user-driven scene.

  <h2>Visual Structure</h2>
  The first two scenes have identical layout using bar graphs. The exploration scene consists of a scatterplot in the same position
  to minimize disorientation.

  <h2>Scenes</h2>
  Flow through the scenes can be linear or user-directed through the page buttons.
  The linear structure is designed to elicit shock (scene 1), skepticism (scene 2), and concern (scene 3).

  <h2>Annotations</h2>
  <p>Annotations use the same template and are static during the scene, but are reloaded for each individual scene.</p>
  
  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  The common parameters for all scenes are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Scene number</b> - scenes are rendered in the same window, and scene number is a parameter
    that drives the presentation.</li>
    <li><b>Scene title, sidebar text, chart titles</b>- these elements are parameters that change based on the scene</li>
  </ul>

  Parameters that are specific to the author-driven portion (scenes 0-3) are: 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Annotation aiming point, position, text</b> - annotations are parameterized with an aiming point (using 
    data coordinates rather than screen coordinates), a text offset and the content of the annotation</li>
    <li><b>Chart type and axis, date range</b> - depending on the scene and point being made, the visualization
      will show or hide one or another of the two main axes (citations, papers) and limit the date range to draw
      reader focus on a certain period of time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Triggers</h2>
  <p>The first trigger is the completion of the HTML page load, which invokes the routines to initialize the visualization.</p>
  <p>This is followed by the CSV data load, during which a "Loading data ... " message is presented. When the CSV data
    load finishes a trigger causes the first scene to be rendered.</p>

  <p>The user advances through the presentation by clicking the forward- and backward buttons. This triggers a change
  in state variable (scene/frame) which updates the page buttons (active/inactive/selected) as well as the
    common parameters described above: scene title, chart title, sidebar text, chart, axis, date range.
  </p>
  <p>On the reader-driven chart, mousing over a point on the scatterplot displays a tooltip with the debt:income ratio.</p>
